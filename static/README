              -----------------------------
              Version 0.5 of the iaria class
                  Christoph P. Neumann
              -----------------------------

This package contains templates for the creation of documents for
IARIA publications (International Academy, Research, and Industry Association)
and implements the specifications for the IARIA citation style.

This class does not contain evil low-level TeX magic
but instead uses many other fancy LaTeX packages
that we hope you have already installed.

DISCLAIMER: This class is neither for XeLaTeX or LuaTeX
nor for legacy bibtex or natbib. For these have a look
at CTAN package iaria-lite.

and version 1.3c or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
version 2008/05/04 or later.


Installation
------------

After unzipping the package call:

  $ latex iaria.ins

This will be extract some files (iaria.cls, iariaNLS.sty...). Create a
directory beneath your TeX installation preferably create 

  tex/latex/iaria

and copy all files of the package and the extracted files to that directory.

Call:

  mktexlsr


Templates
---------

In the template directory you can find an example document.
